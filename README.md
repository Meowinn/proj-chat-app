# proj-chat-app
I haven't finished the project since I have not studied back end development yet, the code you see here is the accumulation of googling answers and watching tutorials. It uses reactjs and node as per instructions along with socket.io as the library to send data as web sockets. 

On the project's server directory, run 'npm start' to initiate server. open client page via react 'npm start' and info should be routed to the server.
